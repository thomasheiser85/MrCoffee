## Hardware

- WEMOS D1 mini pro (ESP8266)
- Servo SG90

## Assembly

- I used double sided tape to attach the servo.
- The cable clips are 3D printed and also taped at the machine.
- A 3D printed case for the wemos is in work.


## Features

- Turn on the machine
- Web UI / interface
- nothing more... 


See demo on YouTube:

## Maybe Future Features (normally they will be never implemented)

 - Time based turn on (this is currently done with an external FHEM who uses the web interface)
 - Light sensor to detect if the machine is already turned on.
